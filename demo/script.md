## CalmMind Demo Script (3 Minutes)

1. **Hook (0:20)**
   - “CalmMind is your phone’s quiet nudge before migraine chaos hits.”
   - Highlight zero extra hardware + passive sensing.

2. **Figma Walkthrough (0:50)**
   - Show onboarding consent, automation toggles, and silent monitoring screen.
   - Play notification → chatbot → automation microflow.

3. **Agent Simulation (0:50)**
   - Run `npm run simulate` (or show pre-recorded output) to demonstrate risk scoring and automatic dim/DND actions from mock Digital Wellbeing data.
   - Explain logistic + rule hybrid, per-user baselines.

4. **Chatbot Conversation (0:40)**
   - Run `npm run chatbot` to display proactive chat snippet triggered by high risk.
   - Emphasize minimal user input—quick replies only when needed.

5. **Cloud Assist (0:30)**
   - Execute `node cloud/mock_function.ts` to show Google Cloud hook tuning weights for a cohort.
   - Mention Vertex AI/Firestore big-picture pipeline.

6. **Close & Call to Action (0:30)**
   - Summarize impact: prevents migraines with almost no interaction.
   - Outline next steps (real API integration, Android build, cohort trials).

### Backup Plan
- Record terminal runs + Figma prototype as MP4 to play if live demo hiccups.
- Have mock notification screenshots accessible in deck.

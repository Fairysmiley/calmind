The Challenge
Use biometric signals and digital behavior to forecast migraine episodes before they hit.

Migraine affects over a billion people and are one of the leading causes of short-term disability worldwide. Despite this, many migraine patients fail to treat their migraine attacks with their current medication, and often wait until symptoms are unbearable. With your help, we aim to turn migraine care from reactive to predictive. This is your chance to help individuals stay productive, improve life quality for millions, and build solutions that could scale globally.

Design a prototype that predicts migraine onset using signals such as HRV, sleep patterns, screen time, digital calendar activity or any other passive, or contextual signal. The ideal solution should work in the background, minimize manual input, and empower users with insights into their own trigger patterns. You may also experiment with personal AI agents or layered UX, keeping the solution simple, sticky, and clinically meaningful.

Insight
We’re especially excited about hybrid solutions that combine wearable data, passive inputs, and lightweight UX like calendar events, location, or screen time. Personal AI agents that analyze private data with user consent could add significant value.

Resources
Participants will get access to fact sheet about migraine and relevant research papers. Suggested data includes wearable metrics, digital calendar logs, screen time, and sleep. Support available from Pfizer's and Aava's team.

Pfizer and Aava have invested heavily in migraine R&D and digital health innovation. We’re excited to see how data and design can combine to create real-world impact. Our goal is to prototype digital health interventions that are predictive, practical, and personal. Whether it’s a mobile app, dashboard, or wearable integration – we’re looking for solutions that go beyond theory.
